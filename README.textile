h1. JGoogleAnalyticsTracker

h2. Introduction

p. JGoogleAnalyticsTracker is a java api for sending out Google tracking data.  I developed it so I could use Google's fantastic analytics software on java gui applications, as Google never made a java implementation for sending tracking data.

h2. Usage

p. The api is fairly straightforward, to start you make your config data:

@AnalyticsConfigData config = new AnalyticsConfigData("MyTrackingCode");@
@// set any config parameter@
@config.setScreenResolution("1280x800");@
@// etc@

p. You set up the @JGoogleAnalyticsTracker@ with the config and a version (right now only 4.7.2, but it's there for when Google updates their tags and such):

@JGoogleAnalyticsTracker tracker = JGoogleAnalyticsTracker.getInstance();@
@tracker.initialize(config, GoogleAnalyticsVersion.V_4_7_2);@

p. and then you can send tracking data with the @trackPageView@ and @trackEvent@ methods.
